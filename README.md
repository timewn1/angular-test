# ConnectNowTest
# ConnectNow Test Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.1.
The purpose of this project is for demonstrating ability of organizing project structure, reusable components and how to use modern languages such as typescript and html5 also scss and other relevant technologies.

## Development server
## Setting Up Environment

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
* `node.js` and `npm` is primarily required to run this project on your local.
* There's no need to have [Angular](https://angular.io) environment but maybe helpful.
* Clone the repository or just download the `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file and extract it.

## Code scaffolding
```bash
# Setting up node_modules (npm packages)
$ npm install
# Run the project on the local
$ npm run start
```

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
* After following above steps, navigate to `http://localhost:4200` on your browser to check the running website.

## Build
## Short Description

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Design implementation, functional implementation along with the mobile responsive is the core feature of this test task.

## Running unit tests
## Implementation Details

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
* There are two pages `/` (root page - Video Games Page) and `/contact` (contact page - Contact page).
* Both pages are fully mobile responsive in different devices including phone and tablet view.
* Application is storing the data as in a service and work similar as redux pattern but very manually. This will demonstrate that developer is just familiar with all progressive programing.
* Design specifications are correctly implemented using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) along with recommended fonts.
* General code quality is supported by the [Prettier](https://prettier.io) and also IDE configuration. (If you use VS Code, you need to install prettier plugin on your editor.)
* Typescript - Defined all types and models using the typescript to make sure developer is following the best practice and modern cookbooks.
* Using different method of handling asynchronous actions using promise/rxjs and so on, used different methods in different places to show you cases.
